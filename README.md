## What is this?
This is a hack template coded in C++ that will help you make internal hacks(or really any code that reads/writes to a process).

## Code Example/Documentation
Main.cpp should already be a good starting point, also the code isn't that big so you probably can use all it provides within 10 minutes of reading it.
